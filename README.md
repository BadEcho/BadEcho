This repo contains the code for all Bad Echo technologies, from powerful .NET frameworks that extend across a variety of domains, to the Omnified ecosystem that I leverage to inject a bit of insanity into the games I play.

## Getting in Contact
I'm a partnered Twitch streamer, and talking to me during one of my [Omnified streams](https://twitch.tv/omni) is most definitely the quickest way to get my attention!
