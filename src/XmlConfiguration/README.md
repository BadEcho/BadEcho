The `BadEcho.XmlConfiguration` library provides support for classic .NET XML configuration to [Bad Echo](https://badecho.com) core frameworks. It provides a number of useful extensions to `System.Configuration` objects that make working with classic .NET XML configuration files easier to do.

As the approach to configuration taken by `System.Configuration` is essentially being retired, this library exists outside of Bad Echo's core frameworks; it is meant to provide compatibility with legacy XML configurations if some kind of need should arise, as well as showcase code which I got a lot of use out of when actually having to deal with _app.config_-like configurations.

This package exists to be used by specific Bad Echo applications, but is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License so that others may enjoy it as well; see the accompanying [license](https://github.com/omniscientist/BadEcho/blob/master/LICENSE.md) for details.

## About Bad Echo
Bad Echo is a collection of software technologies and [various writings](https://badecho.com) by Matt Weber: a software designer, partnered [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/omni) streamer, and game developer.

While Bad Echo code concerns itself a great deal with the "best approaches" to general software problems, its ultimate focus and goal is to provide entertainment through the clever manipulation of games and the creation of new ones.

## Getting in Contact
I'm a partnered Twitch streamer, and talking to me during one of my [Omnified streams](https://twitch.tv/omni), on the off chance that I actually _am_ streaming, is most definitely the quickest way to get my attention!
